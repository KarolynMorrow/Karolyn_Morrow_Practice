    * List is the most popular.
    * Can contain duplicate items unlike Set
    * access elements by index
    *
    *
    * ArrayList - a resizable array,allows for duplicate and null values, ordered collection
    * LinkedList - Not a good choice for random access
    *
    *
    * Supported Collections Algorithms:
     * Sorting - reorders a List so that elements are in ascending order (according to its elements natural ordering OR sorts with a Comparator)
     * Shuffling - does the opposite of sort, destroys any trace of order, could be use to shuffle a list of Card objects representing a deck
     * Routine data manipulation -
     *           reverse - reverses the order of elements in list
     *           fill - overwrites every element in a List with a specified value. Useful for reinitializing
     *           copy - takes two arguments, a destination List and a source List, and copies from source to destination list
     *           swap - swaps the elements at the specified position in list
     *           addAll - adds all the specified elements to a Collection. Could be specified individually or as an array.
     * Searching - has binarySearch() method for searching a specified element in a sorted list
