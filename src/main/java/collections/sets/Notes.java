    /*
    SETS:
     * HashSet(); Order is not guaranteed, faster than TreeSet, most commonly used
     * TreeSet(); Order according to values
     * LinkedHastSet(); Order based on insertion (least recently inserted to most recent)
     *

     Example:
     numbers are added in following order: 2 3 4 1 2
     Set type = HashSet[3,2,4,1]
     Set type = TreeSet[1,2,3,4]
     Set type = LinkedHashSet[2,3,4,1]

     Operations:
     comparator() - returns the comparator associated with this sorted set
     first() - returns the first(lowest) element in the sorted set
     last() - returns the last(highest) element in the sorted set.



     Natural comparison method ----> compareTo
     Natural ordering
     Examples:
     Strings --->  alphabetical order
     Dates ----->chronological order
     Integer ---> numerical order
